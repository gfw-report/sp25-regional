    Abstract = {Research on Internet censorship is hampered by poor models of censor behavior. Censor models guide the development of circumvention systems, so it is important to get them right. A censor model should be understood not just as a set of capabilities---such as the ability to monitor network traffic---but as a set of priorities constrained by resource limitations.

My research addresses the twin themes of modeling and circumvention. With a grounding in empirical research, I build up an abstract model of the circumvention problem and examine how to adapt it to concrete censorship challenges. I describe the results of experiments on censors that probe their strengths and weaknesses; specifically, on the subject of active probing to discover proxy servers, and on delays in their reaction to changes in circumvention. I present two circumvention designs: domain fronting, which derives its resistance to blocking from the censor's reluctance to block other useful services; and Snowflake, based on quickly changing peer-to-peer proxy servers. I hope to change the perception that the circumvention problem is a cat-and-mouse game that affords only incremental and temporary advancements. Rather, let us state the assumptions about censor behavior atop which we build circumvention designs, and let those assumptions be based on an informed understanding of censor behavior.}

  abstract = {People are accustomed to using an anonymous network to protect their private information. The Profile HMM (Hidden Markov Model) Website Fingerprinting Detection algorithm can detect the website that the data stream accesses by pattern matching the captured data traffic. This makes the anonymous network lose its effect. In order to bypass the detection of this model, we propose a method based on genetic algorithm to generate adversarial samples. By migrating the problem of adversarial samples in deep learning, our approach is used for the broader machine learning detection model to do traffic confusion, and then achieves the purpose of bypassing the Profile HMM model detection. The key challenge is how to construct a suitable fitness function to generate an effective adversarial sample at minimal cost. The experimental results show that the success rate of our traffic confusion method is as high as 97\%. At the same time, we only need to add less perturbation traffic than the traditional traffic confusion method.}

It could also serve as a basis for the TCP extension that is being discussed within the TCPINC working group to provide unauthenticated encryption and integrity protection of TCP streams.},

The vulnerability, one of the most consequential since the advent of the commercial Internet, allowed attackers to remotely read protected memory from an estimated 24--55% of popular HTTPS sites. In this work, we perform a comprehensive, measurement-based analysis of the vulnerability's impact, including (1) tracking the vulnerable population, (2) monitoring patching behavior over time, (3) assessing the impact on the HTTPS certificate ecosystem, and (4) exposing real attacks that attempted to exploit the bug. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale vulnerability notification experiment involving 150,000 hosts and observe a nearly 50% increase in patching by notified hosts. Drawing upon these analyses, we discuss what went well and what went poorly, in an effort to understand how the technical community can respond more effectively to such events in the future.},

    abstract =  {This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793. It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements. It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.},
